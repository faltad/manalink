Manalink
======
Manalink is some kind of tool where someone can manage data via a ncurses interface.
You can add categories and items (title + description) and browse easily through them.


At the beginning, Manalink was just developed to handle links with description, but actually a user can use any data he wants.


Technologies: C++ and NCurses.
